    "# AI-Based Meal Planning System: Research Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This document summarizes the design of a scalable AI/ML-based system for automated meal planning. The goal is to construct daily (or weekly) meal plans from a large recipe dataset, optimizing for nutritional needs such as calorie and macronutrient targets, without relying on classical optimization methods like MILP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern approaches incorporate deep learning, generative models, and reinforcement learning to select and assemble meals with realistic portion sizes and diversity.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Andrikopoulou et al. (2024)  \n",
    "**Title**: “A deep learning approach for automatic meal plan generation”  \n",
    "**Key Contributions**:\n",
    "- The authors frame meal planning as a **sequential generation problem**, where a set of meals is constructed over time.\n",
    "- They propose a hybrid model using:\n",
    "  - A **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for generating meal sequences (i.e., which meals to place in a plan).\n",
    "  - A **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** to model and encode individual meals into a latent nutritional space.\n",
    "- The system is trained on structured meal plan datasets, with each plan composed of meals and meals composed of recipes.\n",
    "- The RNN operates on the latent space produced by the VAE, enabling generation of **diverse but nutritionally consistent** plans.\n",
    "- Optimization is done through a **reconstruction loss** and a **KL divergence penalty**, ensuring realism and constraint alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Papastratis et al. (2024)  \n",
    "**Title**: “Towards personalized and explainable AI-driven meal planning”  \n",
    "**Key Contributions**:\n",
    "- The authors propose an **interactive AI system** combining:\n",
    "  - A **VAE** to embed meals into a latent space\n",
    "  - A **language model (ChatGPT)** to interpret user goals, dietary preferences, and constraints in natural language\n",
    "- ChatGPT is used to **translate user instructions into structured optimization inputs**, such as:\n",
    "  - Number of meals per day\n",
    "  - Preference for diversity\n",
    "  - Dietary exclusions\n",
    "- The VAE provides a **generative model** capable of sampling diverse meals within a desired latent region that corresponds to the user’s macro/micro-nutrient needs.\n",
    "- The system optimizes over **meal-level diversity** while maintaining overall plan consistency, using a latent space traversal method guided by constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Design Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "These papers suggest a **two-part architecture**:\n",
    "1. A **generative model (VAE or RNN)** learns the underlying structure of valid meals and meal combinations in a latent nutrition space.\n",
    "2. A **controller** (RNN or language model) orchestrates the selection of meals from this latent space, based on user intent and nutritional targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a system capable of:\n",
    "- Generating realistic, nutritionally coherent meal plans\n",
    "- Handling both hard constraints (e.g., “no dairy”) and soft goals (e.g., “maximize diversity”)\n",
    "- Adapting to different user types through dialogue-based interfaces or latent conditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Broader Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "These works demonstrate that:\n",
    "- **Deep generative models** can be used as surrogates for large-scale, discrete optimization problems in nutrition planning\n",
    "- **User preferences and constraints** can be modeled as latent conditions or prompts\n",
    "- **Meal planning at scale** (e.g., over 100,000 recipes) becomes feasible using learned embeddings, retrieval layers, and differentiable controllers"
