THEN, sprinkle salt evenly over the dough and knead again until the salt is well incorporated. Set aside in warm place (85F) until doubled in size --  proceed with shaping dough as desired. For those who prefer a more crunchy crust, use only egg white for brushing the loaf - and throw 1/4 cup of water onto the bottom of the oven (avoid heating element if you have an electric oven) - immediately place the loaf in the oven and bake as directed --  the water will create steam and gives the bread a crispier crust. When I prefer a soft crust, I whisk a whole egg (not just the yolk). Also, bread is typically ready when an instant read thermometer inserted into the bread registers 190-200*F. For bread sticks omit brushing the dough with egg. Delicious!", 'You definitely DO NOT need a bread machine for these. Simply combine the water, yeast, and sugar and allow to proof. Then add the salt, then flour and knead until no longer sticky. Place in an oiled bowl and allow to rise according to recipe instructions. I rolled my dough out and made 2 baguettes. I really think I'll make 3 baguettes next time because I use mine for sandwiches and they were a little too big. After baking, I cut the top off the whole length of the baguette so that the top looks like an upside down triangle (like they do at Subway). This leaves me with a bottom piece that is concave in the middle. I then put 2 pieces of provolone cheese and then top it with Chicken Salad. I put the filled bottom piece in the oven by itself for about 7 minutes. Then I put mayo on the top piece, and place it in the oven with the bottom piece, and I let it heat for about another 5 minutes or so. It's GREAT! The bread is slightly crusty on the outside, moist and soft on the inside -- a far cry from those chewy store-bought baguettes. For me: This one's a keeper for sure. Oh, and they freeze well, too."]

It came out the same. This nukes well and is easily pre-made. I had enough yams to fill 2 loaf pans almost to the rim, but it came out a little soft (like baby food). So, in this case, I would have added an extra egg to give it extra firmness. Last time it was was just enough to fill 2 loaf pans 3/4 full and 2 eggs gave it enough firmness. Splenda for the yams and brown-sugar splenda for the topping worked well. ======== I\"ve been attempting various sweet potato dishes for the last few years from this site because other family members expect some sweet potato dish during Thanksgiving. They all came out similar to most sweet potato dishes we\"ve tried in the past. Nothing made us go, Hmmmmm  --  sweet potatoes? I made two alterations to this recipe. I substituted Splenda for the white sugar and I nuked this dish instead of baking it in the oven (there wasn\"t room due to the turkey).

For a beginner, I would recommend just a teaspoonful of egg at a time: if you add it like this, it won't curdle. (Why shouldn't it curdle, you're thinking? Well, some of the hidden air that by now has been beaten into the mixture will escape if the mixture \"breaks\" and as air is what makes a cake light, curdling will make it heavier.).\", \"When the eggs have been incorporated, take a metal tablespoon, which will cut and fold the flour in much better than a thick wooden spoon. Have the flour in a sieve resting on a plate, then lift the sieve high above the bowl and sift about a quarter of it on to the mixture - then replace the sieve on the plate and lightly and gently fold the flour into the mixture (if you beat the flour in, you'll lose some of the precious air). Then repeat this until all the flour is incorporated: lifting the sieve up high above the bowl will ensure the flour gets a good airing before it reaches the mixture.\", \"Now the flour has been added you should have a mixture that will drop off the spoon easily when you tap it on the side of the bowl. If not, add some hot water, one or two teaspoonfuls or if you're using medium eggs you may need a tablespoonful more. Now divide the mixture equally between the prepared tins - if you want to be very precise you could place both tins on the balance scales (I've never bothered because, quite honestly, I don't mind if one sponge is fractionally larger than the other.) Place them on the centre shelf of the oven, and they'll take about 25-30 minutes to cook.\", \"When they are cooked, the centres will feel springy when lightly touched with a little fingertip and no imprint remains. I think the secret of success here is to be patient and not to have crafty peeps halfway through: a sudden rush of cold coming into the oven can cause the cakes to sink. When they're cooked, remove them from then oven, then after about 1 minute turn them out on to a wire cooling tray, loosening them around the edges with a palette knife first. Then carefully peel off the base papers and leave the cakes to cool completely before sandwiching them together with jam and sifting a little icing sugar over the surface.\", \"Then fillings can vary from just jam or a mixture of jam and whipped cream, to lemon curd or chocolate fudge icing. Also you can flavour the cake mixture with grated lemon or orange rind or a few drops of vanilla extract. For a coffee flavour, dilute a tablespoon of instant coffee with a dessertspoon of hot water. For a chocolate flavour, take out a level tablespoon of flour and replace it with a level tablespoon of cocoa.\", \"Note: For an 8 inch (20 cm) sponge cake, use 6 oz (175g) of each ingredient and 3 eggs.\"]

Good chocolate will appeal to all of your senses, and if the brand you are eating and cooking doesn't excite your taste, smell, touch, sight and hearing, switch brands. When deciding on what chocolate to choose, taste and smell are important. The chocolate should feel firm and supple, look glossy and smooth, and break with a pleasing \"snap.\".\", \"COMMANDMENT #2: Never Neglect Ganache. Ganache is the magical amalgamation of chocolate and cream. It is both the chocolatier's workhorse and fairy godmother. When heated, it's a sauce or a glaze; when cooled it's a truffle or a frosting.\", \"COMMANDMENT #3: Always Reinvent Your Cookies. Change up chocolate chip cookies with white or milk chocolate chunks or chips. Oh, and most cookies are better if you drizzle them with melted chocolate.\", \"COMMANDMENT #4: Don't Turn Your Nose Up at the Microwave. I almost always melt chocolate in the microwave these days. It's ready when the liquid pool appears soft and shiny.\", \"COMMANDMENT #5: Store Your Chocolate Wisely. Store chocolate in a cool, dark place. Make sure it's well wrapped. The refrigerator is not the best place to store chocolate because of the humidity.\", \"COMMANDMENT #6: More is Best. Never hesitate to cut brownies into larger squares than the recipe indicates.\", \"COMMANDMENT #7: Stay Away From Hot Cococa Mix. When a recipe calls for cocoa powder, remember it means unsweetened cocoa powder (not hot cocoa mix!).\", \"COMMANDMENT #8: When You Make Truffles—Wear Latex Gloves. They'll keep the ganache from sticking to your warm palms.\", \"COMMANDMENT #9: Adhere to the Golden Rules of Ganache. Rule #1: When you make ganache, always pour the hot cream over chopped chocolate. Never melt the chocolate first. Rule #2: Don't refrigerate hot or even warm ganache or the fat will separate. Let it cool to room temperature first.\", \"COMMANDMENT #10: Don't Substitute Milk Chocolate for Dark Chocolate. The milk solids in milk chocolate are heat sensitive, which is why you can't substitute milk chocolate for dark chocolate in baking recipes.\", \"NOTE: A few delicious recipes from Fritz Knipschildt's Chocopologie: Mini Molten Chocolate Cakes and Chocolate Martini Cocktail.\"]

Also, I cannot emphasize enough to just lightly knead the dough 10 times; over-kneading will produce a tough biscuit.

A pastry blender, which breaks the shortening into little lumps works great for cutting inches If you don\"t have one, you can crisscross two table knives through the flour and shortening or use a wire whisk.\", \"Tip Two: Use a biscuit cutter dipped in flour to cut the dough, pushing the cutter straight down through the dough. If you twist as you cut, the biscuits will be uneven. Cut the biscuits as close together as possible. If you don't have a biscuit cutter, use the end of an open 6-ounce juice can or other narrow can or glass, or use cookie cutters for fun shapes. Dip in flour before cutting.\"]
