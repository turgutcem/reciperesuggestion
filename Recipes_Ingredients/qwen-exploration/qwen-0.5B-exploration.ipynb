       "25924  Simply Sweet Pickles (No Processing Required)  This is the simplest recipe ever! I've canned a lot of pickles, and this is now our favorite sweet pickle recipe.  And the beauty of it is there is no water bath required!  It has a little kick to it from tobasco sauce.  I do NOT like hot, spicey food so I was sceptical at first, but trust me, there is just enough kick to this to make it interesting.
