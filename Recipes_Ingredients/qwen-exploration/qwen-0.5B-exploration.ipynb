    "# 🧪 Qwen 0.5B Exploration – Semantic Recipe Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the use of the **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** model as a lightweight baseline for rephrasing recipe-related questions into structured JSON queries. It also integrates FAISS-based semantic search over recipe text embeddings to retrieve relevant results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧰 Workflow Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Dataset Loading and Cleanup**\n",
    "- The recipe dataset (`filtered_recipes.csv`) is loaded and inspected.\n",
    "- YAML-formatted `steps` are parsed using a custom fallback mechanism.\n",
    "- Invalid rows are dropped and the dataset is saved to `parsed_recipes.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. String Field Restoration**\n",
    "- After reloading the parsed dataset, stringified columns like `ingredients`, `ingredients_raw`, `amount_gram`, `amounts`, and `tags` are converted back into Python list/dict structures using `ast.literal_eval`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Embedding and Clustering**\n",
    "- Uses **`SentenceTransformer (MiniLM-L6-v2)`** to embed combined `name + description` text.\n",
    "- Vectors are normalized and clustered using **FAISS KMeans** into 100 clusters.\n",
    "- The nearest recipe to each cluster centroid is selected as a **representative sample**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Prompt Generation and Question Answering**\n",
    "- A function is defined to generate:\n",
    "  - A general user-style question from the recipe.\n",
    "  - A concise answer based on the description.\n",
    "- OpenAI’s GPT is used to generate these (e.g., “What is this dish?”).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Semantic Retrieval with FAISS**\n",
    "- The questions are embedded and queried against the original recipe text embeddings using FAISS.\n",
    "- Retrieval results are compared to see whether the source recipe is among the top-k hits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Qwen Model Evaluation**\n",
    "- The **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** model is loaded and queried locally.\n",
    "- A prompt-based function asks Qwen to rephrase questions into a JSON format with two keys:\n",
    "  - `search_query`\n",
    "  - `requested_count`\n",
    "- The results are evaluated based on whether the original recipe is successfully retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Known Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🧪 Baseline Scope**\n",
    "- This setup uses a **baseline Qwen model** without any fine-tuning.\n",
    "- Currently, it **only utilizes**:\n",
    "  - `name`\n",
    "  - `description`\n",
    "- It **does not include** richer recipe metadata such as:\n",
    "  - `ingredients`\n",
    "  - `steps`\n",
    "  - `tags`\n",
    "  - `nutritional information`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **⚙️ JSON Parsing Accuracy**\n",
    "- The Qwen model:\n",
    "  - Struggles with **consistent JSON formatting**.\n",
    "  - Often fails to generate a valid or accurate `requested_count` field.\n",
    "- These errors reduce the robustness of downstream search.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔧 **Future work** may involve fine-tuning Qwen on structured data prompts to:\n",
    "- Improve JSON compliance.\n",
    "- Control the structure and schema of rephrased queries.\n",
    "- Utilize richer inputs beyond just name and description.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Final Outputs\n",
    "- Cluster-level questions and answers: `cluster_questions.csv`\n",
    "- Model evaluation log with captured queries: `captured_by_qwen` column\n",
    "- Manual review samples for failure cases: `review_df`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a lightweight baseline for evaluating small LLMs in recipe retrieval workflows. It opens doors for future improvements in rephrasing reliability, schema adherence, and multimodal context inclusion.\n"
